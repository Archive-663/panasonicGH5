### In this repository:
- [Slim Bracket](https://github.com/Archive-663/panasonicGH5/tree/main/slimBracket)

### Background Story:
I wanted a more compact way to mount my GH5 to my tripod while giving me just a little more grip. So I designed this 12mm bracket that's compatible with Arca-Swiss mount tripod heads. I plan on expanding this to a compact video rigging bracket, but for now it is enough for me.
